#Q-ME
Our _JavaScript_ app is meant to assist job seekers in interview training. A user will sign up using his LinkedIn account, for that we used Omniauth and the **LinkedIn API**. Once signed up, the user's details are saved in the _SQlite_ database. At this point the user will receive three random job interview question, his answers will be recorded and watched by other users that would rate their performance. In addition to job seekers, recruiters will also be able to sign up and give feedback to job seekers, they will be able to sponsor their priority interview questions for a fee that will be paid using the **visa API**.  
The SQlite database contains eight tables: 
* comments
* companies
* interviews
* performances
* questions
* ratings
* recruiters
* users
 

Our counted five members and we created this app during the [**eMerge America Hackathon**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/emerge-americas-2016-hackathon-tickets-21063558671?mc_cid=cf19eb3df4&mc_eid=[UNIQID]), a 24 hour intensive coding challenge.
